# react-mfe-boilerplate

A 2024 Reactjs micro-frontend boilerplate bundled with Webpack.

## Libraries and tools

- [`ReactJS`](https://react.dev/)
- [`Typescript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [`Webpack`](https://webpack.js.org)
- [`Jest`](https://jestjs.io/)
- [`Testing Library`](https://testing-library.com/)

## Setup

### Host

Inside the `/host` folder, you can see the main application used to consume and integrate remote modules.

Follow the `README.md` file to configure it properly.

### Remotes

Inside the `/remote` folder, there is an example configuration for webpack that must be used to expose any module. Just as the **remote** example, you can have multiple remotes exposed to the **host**.

Follow the `README.md` file to configure it properly.

## Important to mention

- This template works with Webpack 5 or greater.
- Custom configuration may be needed for packages with different frameworks.
